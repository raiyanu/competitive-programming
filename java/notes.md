## important
*DataType Psychology:* primitive data types are faster but has less features/methods aka functions to work with them. while,non-primtive data types are slower but has lots of features/methods aka functions to work with them.

In System level approach considering primitive DataTypes can lead to faster computation.

Non-primitive are also known as wrapper cuz they wrap the value with class from java-collections, these collections are already comes inbuilt with JDK, but when we perform regular actions such as passing value to print stateent or comparint or any activities compiler just returns real value aka primitive values, only when we perform statement which access methods then only it works like class with lots of godblessed methods!

*ArrayList<DataType>:* While mentioning DataType for ArrayList, we gotta make sure it's non-primitive DataType. cuz they only take Non-Primitive DataType. Maybe appliesfor other stuffs too...?
